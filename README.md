# üéØ Hyper-Personalized Advertisement Generation using Generative AI

## üß† Overview

Traditional advertisements often adopt a one-size-fits-all approach, which fails to resonate with diverse customer segments. Our project addresses this by leveraging **Generative AI on Google Cloud Vertex AI** to automate the creation of personalized marketing assets ‚Äî especially ad creatives tailored to individual personas.

Imagine marketing an ice cream differently to a child, a fitness enthusiast, and a retiree ‚Äî all automatically, without hiring an entire creative team.

This framework allows businesses to:
- Dynamically generate visuals for different customer personas
- Extract meaning from those visuals for governance or personalization validation
- Store outputs in scalable, auditable storage
- Envision a full-text-based generation system for personalized emails *(future roadmap)*
